I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Shannon Quinn, whose endless support, genuine care, and remarkable patience guided me through this Ph.D. journey. Thank you for standing by me and patiently helping me find direction whenever I felt most lost. Your encouragement, understanding, and unwavering belief in my capabilities have shaped not only my research but also my growth as an individual and scholar.
