\chapter*{Dedication}
To my parents, Ali and Azam, whose unconditional love, sacrifice, and wisdom taught me resilience and compassion, guiding me every step of the way. And to Niloofar, my partner and best friend, whose boundless energy, unwavering belief in me, and remarkable strength showed me what perseverance and passion truly mean. Your presence in my life has made every challenge surmountable and every victory sweeter.
